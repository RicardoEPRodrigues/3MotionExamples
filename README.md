# 3Motion Examples

These Qt applications were created to evaluate the expressive potential of [3Motion](https://github.com/RicardoEPRodrigues/3Motion) in a Text-based Application environment.

To correctly test the application, download and compile the 3Motion library in the same parent directory as these examples. See [HelloWorld.pro](https://github.com/RicardoEPRodrigues/3MotionExamples/blob/master/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.pro) to understand where the application is trying to find the library.
